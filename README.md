# web-scraping-challenge

The website was created using the HTML files and images within this folder. The data and images were scraped from/
[https://mars.nasa.gov/news/] and [https://data-class-jpl-space.s3.amazonaws.com/JPL_Space/index.html], respectively./
From there, the images and data were incorporayed into the github website one I created. Additionally, Flask was used.
